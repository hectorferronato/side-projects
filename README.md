Expanding, applying, and sharing CS concepts.

 This repository is being updated with past projects I have created to **teach medium/advanced algorithms to beginner Computer Science students in a fun, more visual and contextual way**.

- [X] Create repository.
- [] Upload most relevant projects from previous years.

Algorithms with fun and in context:

- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - **maze-path-find.py** is a class implementation of the solution to find if there's a path from a Maze's origin to its goal. The class has printing options for the traversed Maze (grid), and the path traverse in detail.
