# Hector's Side Projects
Expanding, applying, and sharing CS concepts.

 This repository is being updated with past projects I have created to **learn more and teach medium/advanced algorithms to beginner Computer Science students in a fun, more visual and contextual way**. The goal has been to find the best use of CS to cause social impact and improve educational methods.

- [ ] Upload most relevant projects from previous years.

Projects:

- ## **Chat Bots**:

  - **[Amar Chatbot](Amar-Chatbot/)** is a happy and motivational Chatbot __in development__ to provide a quick conversation with users. Ultimately, Amar will be able to hold a convesation with only positive (happy and motivational) terms, and scrapple Google, Wikipedia, and Social Media to find cohesive answers for the user's input.
  
      Talk to the basic version using Facebook ChatBot Messenger: [facebook.com/messages/AmarChatbot](https://www.facebook.com/messages/AmarChatbot)

- ## **Browser Extensions**:

  - **[Google Right-Click Multi-Search](Google-Right-Click-Multi-Search/)** is a Chrome extension developed to provide a quick access to all "search-types" Google provides (such as Image, News, and Maps) just by highlighting a word and right-clicking on it.
  
       Install it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-right-click-multi/hacdkngldbgplmdlmdhgiehbmmlckmea)! :)

Algorithms with fun and in context:

- ## **Dynamic Programming**:

  - **[maze-path-find.py](Maze-Path-Finder/maze-path-find.py)** is a class implementation of the DP solution to find if there's a path from a Maze's origin to its goal, only moving downwards or to the right. The class has printing options for the traversed Maze (grid), and the path traverse in detail.
  
       Run: $ python maze-path-find.py

- ## **Games**:

 - **[Piata's World Game](Piatas-World-Game/)** is a platform game I developed together with two other friends in high school (2010). Piata, the main character is saving the forest by completing each "stage", which represents different environmental issues. Thus, by playing the game, middle-school students can learn about Deforestation, Water Pollution, Animal Trafficking, and Recycling.

     To play it, go to: [omundodepiata.com.br/english](www.omundodepiata.com.br/english) and click on "Play" button.
