# Hector's Side Projects
Expanding, applying, and sharing CS concepts.

 This repository is being updated with past projects I have created to **teach medium/advanced algorithms to beginner Computer Science students in a fun, more visual and contextual way**. The goal is to find the best use of CS to cause social impact and improve educational methods.

- [X] Create repository.
- [ ] Upload most relevant projects from previous years.

Algorithms with fun and in context:

- ##**Dynamic Programming**:

  - **[maze-path-find.py] (/maze-path-find.py)** is a class implementation of the DP solution to find if there's a path from a Maze's origin to its goal, only moving downwards or to the right. The class has printing options for the traversed Maze (grid), and the path traverse in detail.
  
   Run: $ python maze-path-find.py
